AET 313: Once Upon An Arduino

A Monster's University Retelling
In this scene at the end of the film, Mike and Sulley are stuck in the human world, but they work together with Mike’s brains and Sulley’s brawn to scare the police officers and escape back to the monster world. We chose this scene because it’s a distinct, deciding scene in the movie that also has lots of potential for interactive adaptation. For example, when the police enter the room, a motor could make the door quickly shut behind them, or a motor could make the scream meter go up when they scare the police officers. Overall, throughout this project, we hope to explore the intricacies of fabricating an enclosure and developing our skills of subtle storytelling.
